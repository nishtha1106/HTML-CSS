		<u><h2>Sushma Swaraj rebuttal in Rajya Sabha: On Doklam, India's roadmap is peace with China, not war.</h2></u>
			<p>Minister of External Affairs, Sushma Swaraj, today raised the Doklam issue in the Rajya Sabha.

Swaraj also targeted the Congress leadership for its stand on the dispute between China, Bhutan and India.

While addressing the leaders, Swaraj heaped praises on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In the last 17 years no prime minister has ever set foot in Nepal - out of which 11 years India was under Congress.

She added that PM Narendra Modi's Lahore visit was an out-of-the box decision.

The external affairs  minister slammed the Congress reminding them of the  blockade that prevailed during Rajiv Gandhi's tenure.

Talking about Centre's stand on the Doklam standoff with China, Swaraj said that India's road map is peace. She said Chinese investment has gone up in a big way and the two countries are in continuous bilateral talks

Swaraj criticised Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi's meeting with the Chinese envoy saying, "I am saddened that the leader of Congress in an attempt to know about India-China stand-off didn't ask the government of India, but chose to meet the Chinese ambassador."</p>

<h4>SWARAJ SLAMS CONGRESS LEADER</h4>

<p>She slammed Congress leader Rajiv Shukla for his comment to CPEC that India should join CPEC."This is matter of Indian Sovereignty, we cannot allow China-Pakistan to allow road corridor in POK," she said.

"Shukla must understand that POK is part of India, this is the stated position of India, how can he speak like this,"  she added.

She even asked how can congress leaders speak in two voice on such a sensitive issue.  </p>

<h4>SWARAJ ON PAKISTAN</h4>

<p>In her address, she emphasised that terrorism and talks cannot go hand in hand. Swaraj said that Pakistan went to denial mode after the Pathankot attack.

Swaraj said that India gave a road map of friendship and that it was one-sided.

While talking about the standoff with China, Swaraj said that war was not the answer for any dispute. She said that India has the support of US and Russia.

About Israel, she said that although it is an ally, India will never let down the Palestinian cause. </p>
